# Python-Workshop
ICME Summer Workshop

The class is designed for people with some experience programming, but no experience in Python.  We will introduce each topic enough so that you can quickly start using Python for your own problems knowing what tools are most appropriate. The workshop will be interactive with many examples (that the participants can play with during the session).

Topics covered
 - Introduction to Python (variables, strings, control-flow, containers, file-IO)
 - Numerical Python (i.e. numpy) and Matplotlib
 - Pandas (i.e. dataframes)

Note that the course notes in this repository are intended to be read through in sequence according to the numerical prefixes in each filename. I.e. we anticipate that learners know all of the information in `1_Introduction_to_Python` before moving on to `2_Numerical_Python`, etc.

If you're curious for more course notes, please see lectures 0-8 from CME 211: https://github.com/CME211/notes#cme-211-notes.
